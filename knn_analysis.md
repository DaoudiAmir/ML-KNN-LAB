## 🎓 Impact of K Selection

| K Value | Bias | Variance | Characteristic |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|
| Small (1-3) | ⬇️ Low | ⬆️ High | Overfitting |
| Optimal (8) | ➡️ Balanced | ➡️ Balanced | Best Performance |
| Large (14+) | ⬆️ High | ⬇️ Low | Underfitting |

## 🎯 Conclusion
The optimal value K=8 achieves the perfect balance between:
- 🎯 Model flexibility
- 🎯 Prediction stability
- 🎯 Generalization capability

This provides the best trade-off between bias and variance for robust predictions.
